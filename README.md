## Coin changer

A program than gives you the smallest possible number of coins as a change.

### Rules
- CoinChanger accepts integers from 1 to 99.
- It returns the smallest possible number number of coins you're going to get
- It uses the following coins:
    - 50 pence;
    - 20 pence;
    - 10 pence;
    - 5 pence;
    - 2 pence;
    - 1 pence.

 For example: if you pass 81 as an argument, coinChanger will return 4 - (one 50 pence, one 20 pence, one 10 pence, one 1 pence).
